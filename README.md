# Habitat ROS Interface

## Stakeholders

List stakeholders for project/feature.

## Motivation
Real world robots move in a continous environment. To this end, we aim to to build on top of the existing Habitat simulator to create a realistic agent transversing through the highly photorealistic 3D environments with ROS connectivity.

## Goals

List goals you are planning on achieving with the project/feature.

1. Connect Habitat simulator environment with ROS so that traditional ROS packages for SLAM and navigation can be used​
2. Test discrete action space trained agents in a kinematic environment​
3. Test discrete action space trained agents in a traditional robotics simulation environment (Gazebo) with complex physcics 

## Design
