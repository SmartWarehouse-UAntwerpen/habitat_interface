## Problem Statement



## Goals

List goals you are planning on achieving with the project/feature.

1. To connect Habitat simulator environment with ROS so that traditional ROS tools such as SLAM and navigation can be used
2. Test the trained agent with discrete action spaces through teleportation in a more realistic way 
3. Test the trained agent with discrete action space in a traditional robotics simulation environment (Gazebo)

## Non-Goals


## Design

See one drive diagram

One-pager of the design and implementation plan. Can be high level and does not
need to call out explicit functional code, though it is up to the owner on how
deep they want to go.

## API

What API endpoints will be exposed to the user as part of this feature?

## Dependencies

List any external component and/or cross functional dependencies.

## Testing

### Functional Testing

Plan for functional testing (automated, non-automated, etc).

### Performance Testing

Plan for performance testing (automated, non-automated, etc) if needed.

### Scale Testing

Plan for scale testing (automated, non-automated, etc) if needed.
