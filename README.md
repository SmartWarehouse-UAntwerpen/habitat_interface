# Habitat ROS Interface

## Stakeholders

List stakeholders for project/feature.

## Motivation
Real world robots move in a continous environment. To this end, we aim to to build on top of the existing Habitat simulator to create a realistic agent transversing through the highly photorealistic 3D environments with ROS connectivity.

## Goals

List goals you are planning on achieving with the project/feature.

1. To connect Habitat simulator environment with ROS so that traditional ROS tools such as SLAM and navigation can be used
2. Test the trained agent with discrete action spaces through teleportation in a more realistic way 
3. Test the trained agent with discrete action space in a traditional robotics simulation environment (Gazebo)
4. To ease the transition from simulation to real by adding complex dynamics to the existing Facebook Habitat platform
